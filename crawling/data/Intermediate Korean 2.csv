중급한국어 2,이윤복,23,Fall,2.0,"장점
The lecturer was fun, engaging and generally explained things well (once they’d actually arrived to class – sometimes they were over 30 minutes late) with frequent real world/YouTube examples of actual Korean in use. We covered a decent range of useful vocabulary through the textbook and the listening exercises in class were fair based on the content we had covered. The lectures being delivered almost entirely in clear, relatively straightforward Korean was also welcome good listening practice, even if I understand it was still a little difficult for some other students in the class. The lecture slides were clearly presented with lots of examples and detailed grammatical explanations when necessary too, clarifying technicalities well.
단점
Sticking to the textbook felt very restrictive with almost no application practice (speaking & writing). We pretty much only practiced reading (this was the only skill that was examined too) with a small bit of listening too. It may have been better to have some discussion based/practice/speaking-centred classes to practice, e.g., our pronunciation and speaking fluency. At this level, classes separate from the textbook dedicated just to applying the structures learned during class would be good.
SNU in general is also missing at least 2 levels between Intermediate 2 and Advanced Korean; the difficulty step between the 2 is far too big.
The pacing of the class was slow: we didn’t manage to finish the textbook as had been in the lecture plan, covering only 2 grammar points/week. The lack of any homework except the straightforward workbook meant we didn’t get to apply any of our learning or receive any feedback. More frequent writing assignments (and more ‘realistic’ reading vs. ‘artificial’ textbook passages) alongside more detailed feedback would be better.
Finally, it felt as if there was little opportunity to get to know classmates since we remained in our initial seats. This meant that if your practice partner was not ideal at the start, you were just unlucky re practice."

중급한국어 2,김주상,19,Spring,3.0,이 강의는 쉽고 교수님도 너무 친절하심. 과제가 2개 밖에 없고 그것도 쉬움. 수업 시간에 배운 문법을 가지고 조별로 대회 만들고 발표하기  (항상). 그런데 발표하는 게 쉬움.
